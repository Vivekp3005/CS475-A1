### Acknowledgement
We hereby confirm that all the code presented in our project has been written exclusively by myself and my partner. We take full responsibility for its creation and development. We use some external sources or third-party contributions and we explicitely mention this at end of ```Readme```

### Running the code
Open the file in your visual code. Ensure that your drivers are updated, glew and glfw libraries are installed succesfully. Then open the new terminal and type ```make``` and press ```enter```. After that execuatable bin file created in ```src/bin```. So to run the code just type ```src/bin/a1sim``` and then press ```enter```. You able to visualise the sprinklr simulation.

we create a two simulation, 1st one is of sprinklr and another one is of fluid flow around non viscid non lifting cylinder. 

Now when you run code the 1st simulation start by default. If you want to shift to 2nd simulation press ```2```. Now if you want to come back to 1st one press ```1```.
Now if you want to pause simulation press ```p``` and if you want to resume simulation press ```r```.

This is basic functionalities of both simulation.

### Explanation
For detail explanation of code refer the ```submit``` present in ```doc``` folder.
